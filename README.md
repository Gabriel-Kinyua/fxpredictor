# Foreign Exchange Forecasting Model (for the paper): Can Interest Rate Factors Explain Exchange Rate Fluctuations?
The level, slope, and curvature of the yield curve are known predictors of excess bond
returns and economic activity, reflecting time variation in investors’ risk premia. In this
paper, I develop a term structure model under complete markets and no arbitrage that
describes exchange rate fluctuations as a function of these interest rate factors. The Gaussian
properties of the stochastic discount factors imply non-linearities in exchange rate risk premia
that can account for up to half of the in-sample variation in one-year currency returns for
different country pairs during the 1980s–2016 period. Interest rate factors can help explain
exchange rate fluctuations in and out of sample, particularly at longer horizons, and yield
profitable currency portfolios relative to standard carry trade strategies.
